I created this Discord bot as a verification and it currently only scrapes data whether you're CS, IT, or IS.

The alive file is mandatory if you want the bot to work without your device running 24/7.
I used Replit to make the script running in the cloud and you can use UptimeRobot to ping the script so it doesn't timeout and turns the script off.

It's still a prototype and there's no guarantee it works all the time but so far if you're FCIT student in King Abdul-Aziz University, it should work.
I'm still just a beginner so there's alot of mistakes and unnecessary steps.
I would love to hear feedback so I can improve this.
